# Grid Component

Native CSS Grid Layout component. Used for layout of your web application. Grid is layed out into rows using Grid.Row and then into columns using Grid.Column.

Grid is divided into 12 columns with a default gutter of 12px. The gutter width can be changed with the theme variable - grid-gutter-width.

Grid.Column takes a size prop. The size is defined as an integer value between 1 and 12. Defaults to 1.
